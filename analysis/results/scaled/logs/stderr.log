Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at D:\openclaw\intelligence-augmentation\models\Geneformer\Geneformer-V1-10M and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
